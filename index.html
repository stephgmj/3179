            Types of Renewable Energy
          </h2>
          <p>
            Victoria generates renewable energy through a few different sources. Wind farms are currently the largest producer of renewable
            energy in Victoria. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The major wind farms in Victoria are located in areas that are generally higher altitude and therefore, on average, see more
            consistently higher wind speeds than other areas. This means that as much energy as possible can be produced by these farms.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are seeing an increase in the usage of solar panels, in both both small-scale (personal) and commercial use. As the technology
            has become more and more affordable, more people have been inclined to install solar panels on their houses so they can also
            reduce the cost of their electricity.

            Over the years...
          </h2>
          <p>
            While the majority of Victoria's energy is being produced by coal, we are seeing a steady increase in energy being produced
            by renewable means, especially wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this increase in renewable energy production, there has also been an overall decrease in the amount of energy being produced 
            by burning coal.

          <h2>
            What does our energy generation look like over a year?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Over the year, we can see that the amount of energy being produced in Victoria increases for the major energy types during the winter
            months. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is to meet demand due to the lesser daylight hours and the increased need for electricity for appliances like heaters during 
            this time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We can also see an increase in the amount of energy being generated by rooftop solar panels during the summer months, thanks to
            longer days and more sunny days overall compared to winter.
